        <h1 class="sec_heading " style="padding-bottom: 0%;">The story behind PRATAKE</h1>
        <div style="display: flex; padding: 2vw; gap: 15px;">
            <p>In 2023, Eshita Dutta, a compassionate and determined young woman, founded PARTAKE, an organization
                dedicated to combating child hunger. Eshita's upbringing in a modest family gave her firsthand
                experience of the hardships faced by the less fortunate. Witnessing the plight of underprivileged
                children in her country, she felt a deep sense of responsibility to make a change.

                Driven by empathy and a desire to make a difference, Eshita established PARTAKE with a clear
                mission: to donate food to impoverished children and ensure they had access to nutritious
                meals.<br><br><br>
                With the support of volunteers, local businesses, and community members, the organization quickly
                took shape. PARTAKE's efforts have since touched the lives of countless children, nourishing their
                bodies and igniting hope for a brighter future. Eshita's inspiring leadership and the collective
                passion of PARTAKE's team have made it a beacon of compassion and care in the fight against child
                hunger.<br><br><br>
                As the years passed, PRATAKE's impact grew exponentially. Through Eshita Dutta's vision and the
                collective efforts of the organization, they not only nourished the bodies of countless impoverished
                children but also nourished their dreams, offering them a chance to escape the grip of poverty and
                reach for a better tomorrow. PRATAKE became a beacon of hope for children in need, lighting the path
                towards a more equitable and compassionate society.

        <div style="display: flex; padding: 2vw; gap: 15px;">
            <img src="./about3.jpg" alt="a little child"
                style="border-radius: 50%; height: 80vh; width: 70vw;padding-top: 15px;">
            <p>PRATAKE envisions a world where hunger is eradicated, and every child's basic nutritional needs are
                met. Our food donation organization is driven by the belief that no child should suffer from hunger
                and malnutrition, regardless of their socioeconomic background. We aspire to create a society where
                every child has access to nutritious and wholesome food, laying the foundation for a healthier and
                brighter future. <br><br>

                Through our unwavering commitment to serve humanity, we aim to bridge the gap between abundance and
                scarcity by collecting surplus food from various sources and redistributing it to those in need. Our
                vision goes beyond short-term relief; we strive to create sustainable solutions by advocating for
                policies that address food insecurity at its root.<br><br>

                PRATAKE is not only focused on providing nourishment but also on empowering communities to become
                self-sufficient. We collaborate with local partners to implement educational programs, vocational
                training, and initiatives that enhance agricultural practices and food production.<br><br>

                As an organization, we envision fostering a sense of compassion and empathy within society, where
                people come together to support one another. We envision a world where people from all walks of life
                actively participate in our mission, contributing their time, resources, and expertise to uplift the
                lives of underprivileged children.<br><br>

                PRATAKE's ultimate vision is to see every child grow up healthy, well-nourished, and full of
                potential. We dream of a world where hunger is a thing of the past, and every child's fundamental
                right to food is upheld. Together, we can build a brighter and more equitable future for the
                generations to come.
